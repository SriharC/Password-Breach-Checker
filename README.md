# Password-Breach-Checker
This Python script allows you to check if your password has been compromised in any data breaches by leveraging the HaveIBeenPwned API. It creates a SHA-1 hash of the password, and sends a request using the first five characters of the hash to the API, and processes the response to determine if the password has been pwned.
